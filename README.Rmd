RStudio addins let you execute a bit of R code or a Shiny app through the RStudio IDE,
either via the Addins dropdown menu or with a keyboard shortcut. 
This package is an RStudio addin for managing **other** addins. To run these addins, you need the
latest version of [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/). 

## Installation

The package can be installed via `devtools`

```
## Need the latest version of DT as well
devtools::install_github('rstudio/DT')
devtools::install_github("csgillespie/addinmanger")
```


## Running addins

After installing the package, the _Addins_ menu toolbar will be populated with the 
new, exported addins. This addin is called __Addin Manager__.

The highlighted addins, `shinyjs` and `ggThemeAssit` have been already installed.

When you click **Done**

 * Highlighted addins will be installed.

Simple!
